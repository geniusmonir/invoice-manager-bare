I need one more field that should be on there which is the ability to mark the invoice as paid or unpaid
That way when I view recites I can sort all the ones that are paid or not

[4:51 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: We have products that come in single, box, or pallet
[4:51 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: yes
[4:52 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: When adding a product There should be three fields for price
[4:52 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: One field for each one
[4:52 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: And all three fields have a hidden status also
[4:54 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: So let's say I have a product
Name.Pop
Desc. Carbonated drink
Image.
Note. Personal
Price
  Single..1$
   Box.. 10$
   Pallet. 1000$
   Category.  Drinks
[4:55 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Now it is required that I put a price for one of them
[4:55 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: If left blank then don't show it on product
[4:55 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: If filled out then show it on product
[4:55 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Let's say I only put in single and box
[4:56 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Only those two should show on the order page
[4:57 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: I can also hide the prices 
 So let's say I wanna show only the box price 
There should be a way where I can hide the single price and only show one price on product page
[4:57 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: One price should be displayed no matter what so I can't hide all the prices
[4:58 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: I can explain more if you still need information about it
[4:59 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: let me show you
[4:59 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Ok
[5:00 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: So now on the product page only single shows
[5:00 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Yes
[5:01 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: One must be true at all time
[5:01 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: yes
[5:01 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: One or more
[5:01 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: thats the idea
[5:01 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Yep
[5:01 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: So i deleted the category idea
[5:01 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Just
[5:02 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: I mean you can leave the Categories and I can give you a static list
[5:02 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: We can make it function the same way as the old project
[5:02 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Where the admin has to add it for it to show on drop down
[5:02 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Thats fine, If you have the static list then i can add that in product
[5:03 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Sounds good
So for these fields some are optional and some are required
[5:04 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: notes are optional
[5:04 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Description and notes are optional
[5:04 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Alright
[5:04 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Notes are visible to only the admin
[5:04 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: When he adds or edits a product
[5:04 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: That's all
[5:04 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Alright i got that.
[5:05 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Thanks

[5:05 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: So this two are the final structure
[5:05 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: So as of now you only need confirmation for the invoice template

[5:06 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: I'm not sure how the discount should be handled tho
[5:06 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: It will be adjusted on invoice
[5:07 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Ok
[5:07 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: do you need the discount on total price or on each item?
[5:07 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Can I add an optional box on both
[5:08 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: let me show you
[5:08 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: If it complicated the process then do it on total
[5:08 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: yes it will be very ok if you put a percentage on total
[5:09 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Well generally we do discounts per product. 
But on occasion we also subtract from the total
[5:09 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: No our discount is $
[5:09 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Alright, How do you want to manage this? on total or on each item? its complecated
[5:10 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: If you want i can do that
[5:10 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: I mean its possible
[5:10 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: So when I order 10 x pop at 10$ each the total becomes a 100$ for that product. 
If I add a discount it should subtract from the total of that product only
[5:11 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: So if I add 10$ discount for that product it will be 90$ total for that product
[5:11 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: I can do it for all the products
[5:12 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: On the same invoice
[5:12 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: And when I have the total price of everything there should be a box where I can add a discount to it
[5:13 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: ü•π
[5:13 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Alright let me show
[5:13 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: If this is too complicated il just do discount from the entire order

[5:13 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: No
[5:13 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: All you will be adding is one field
[5:14 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: So you see this
[5:15 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: If I apply a discount to the first product let's say 100$. It will subtract from the amount on the right and make that 200
[5:15 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: this can be done via this structure
[5:16 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: discount is manual, either you put 1 or put 100 or put 0 its upto you
[5:16 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Yes
[5:16 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: i just need to subtract the amount
[5:16 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: from the total
[5:16 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: of a single item
[5:16 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: i mean single product
[5:17 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Almost lol
[5:17 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Let's say you ordered 2 boxes 10$ each
[5:17 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Your total is 20$
[5:18 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Now I add the discount of 1$
[5:18 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Your total is 19
[5:18 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Make it simpler, i will add another column here named discount.
[5:18 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: that field you just add a number it will subtract from total
[5:18 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Yes for total order on that column
[5:19 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Yes this making sense now
[5:19 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Not for each single product
[5:19 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: yes i got that now
[5:19 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Yes so discount I believe should be outside of the price
[5:19 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: One more question
[5:19 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Yes
[5:20 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Employee name will be added on the fly, so when add customer to the order, which field you want to search? by name? 2. You want to add just the name of employee? or employee phone too or some other field??
[5:20 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: by business Name***
[5:20 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: search**
[5:21 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: So when you search for a business to tie it to the order only show business name and search by business name
[5:22 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Once you click on the business name it should ask if I want to add employee who took order
[5:23 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Yes, which fields you want to fill up then? just name? or name or phone?
[5:23 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: If added then add that field to the invoice if not then leave blank
[5:23 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Name only
[5:23 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Alright. All are making sense now
[5:23 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: One more things please üòê
[5:24 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: so in product page, two type are shown
[5:24 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: single and box
[5:24 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: I'm not sure how we explained after. After adding an employee on the fly if I make another order for that business did we say to do it again or will it be saved
[5:24 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: when customer want to give the order he must have to select a type right?
[5:25 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Yes but sometimes we get an order of the same product but let's say 25 boxes and 1 pallet
[5:25 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Yes you have to do it again, Writing a name is just a 30 sec task. we are not saving employee name in the database. But i will think about it to make it easier if i can save i will do that
[5:26 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: It's ok write it once and it saves to the invoice we can do it again when we do another order
[5:26 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: For that case i need to put the product in two lines, one price for boxes, and one for pallet

[5:26 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Yes
[5:26 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Here the same product will be in two row
[5:27 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Yes so on here you will have a field called type
[5:27 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: One with box and one with pallet, you can increase and decrease the amount from different row
[5:27 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: And it will show two lines if the order has selected both
[5:28 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Yes
[5:28 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Wait amount?
[5:28 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: The amount will not be affected by type
[5:29 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Yes if a customer say select 25 boxes and one pallet, so think about two row, first row the box row, it will show the 250 in total price. in second row, it will show the quantity 1 and total 1000 in second row
[5:29 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Yes
[5:30 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: and the discount field for multiple instances of a single product like this i will add the discount field with the last one
[5:30 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Discount is different for both
[5:30 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: I mean the discount field for boxes will be disabled.
[5:30 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: and the pallet row discount field is editable
[5:31 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: we have just one discount field in our structure
[5:31 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: I'm sorry monir. I made it more complicated
[5:31 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: No no
[5:31 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: its just fine
[5:31 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: just understand
[5:31 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: give me one minute
[5:31 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: We can just scrap the discount for products and just leave on total order
[5:32 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: I can have my works calculate the discount that should be added and put it in total
[5:32 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: That way is easier I think
[5:33 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: let me show you
[5:33 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Ok
[5:34 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Since we have a cart monir I think there's a better way
[5:35 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: so the discount field for box one will be disabled
[5:35 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: I have an easier way
[5:35 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Which one?


[5:35 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: You pick a product and the type we can only select one
[5:36 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Add to cart puts that in on the receipt as a column
[5:36 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: üò∂üò∂ This is the easiest way üòä
[5:36 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Now if you select another type and click add it will add to invoice as a new field
[5:37 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Its making sense now
[5:37 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: So like a radio button
[5:37 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: You can only select one
[5:37 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: And if you want a box and a pallet then you have to add to cart one for each
[5:37 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: so for 25 boxes and 1 pallet you need to put two order
[5:38 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Just like this
[5:38 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Yes
[5:38 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: I got it now
[5:38 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: No problem i understand
[5:38 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Yep that way discount only applies to that order
[5:38 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Yes
[5:38 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: This time its ok.
[5:38 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: You provide a nice logic, Thanks.
[5:39 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Its easier

[5:39 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: 90% of the time tax is not included
[5:40 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: So you see this invoice
[5:41 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: You need the tax field on total price?
[5:41 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: on grand total price right>
[5:41 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: The fields that I need in the bottom are subtotal discount total and shipping and handling
[5:42 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Only some orders have tax applied
[5:42 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: What is a solution for this
[5:42 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: subtotal discount total and shipping and handling
[5:42 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: tax

[5:44 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: is that fine?
[5:44 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Yes that's fine perfect
[5:45 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Alright, Now just confirm the template of recipt

Another button will be in cart page, you will press that button when everything is done with that customer
[6:00 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Not understand something lol. Let's say I am on cart. I click next now I am editing the invoice where I add the discount for total and add tax, shipping and status.. now when I hit the next page it should save automatically to the device as pdf
[6:01 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: I don't want the button to save
[6:01 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Ok its possible
[6:01 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: My workers will forget to press it
[6:01 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: You click next it will save autometically

[6:03 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: I cannot go back
[6:03 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: So you need to add a button any place to tell the app that you are done with that customer
[6:04 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: When pressing next i can clear the cart too
[6:04 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: There should be a cancle order on all the pages order.. customer..cart.. final invoice.. and the send page is just a close
[6:05 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: And there should be a back button to go back one screen

[6:07 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: We are in mobile app, so you can go back anytime to previous page by clicking or swiping the back button
[6:07 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Yes so the moment I hit submit order it saves to the device as pdf.. takes me to the next page.. clears the field and not be able to go back
[6:07 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Back button or icon is good
[6:08 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: This place i just need to clear all the pages in the stack serial to disable the back button. Going back is normal behavior from any page to previous
[6:08 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: My workers will not like swipe
[6:08 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Tab has the back button
[6:08 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: SWIPE is just for ios
[6:08 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: its native feature
[6:09 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Yes you can disable or do what's necessary because at this stage it's final and cannot be changed unless you click on the invoice from the invoice section and only edit the invoice not add or remove products
[6:10 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Yes when its final you can do any change only in all invoice page
[6:10 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Perfect and when I hit save it should replace the old one

[6:11 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Now for product when editing you can filter by category or search by product name
[6:12 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: For business you can only search by name
[6:12 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Ok
[6:13 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: i am really sorry to bother you like this. But at this point i understand almost everything for this project. It will be helpful for me now. Thanks a lot for the time.
[6:14 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Now for invoice when you click on it from main page it should take you to a page where you can see all the invoices sorted automatically by latest
[6:14 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Yes. I understand that
[6:15 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: If everything is sorted in my brain i can do that anyway. Thats why i ask many questions.
[6:15 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Ur good I like that
[6:15 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Thanks
[6:16 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: So when your on the view invoice you should be able to sort them by paid and unpaid where it will show paid or unpaid for all the invoices
[6:17 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Ok.
[6:17 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: It can be done
[6:18 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: And lastly you should be able to search by business name where it will show all the invoices for that one business where I can filter by paid or unpaid
[6:19 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: So as long as I can search an invoice, filter by status, or Search a business and filter by status it's good
[6:19 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: You want to search invoice by business name?
[6:19 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: I want to pull up the invoice for a single business
[6:19 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: To check my history for that business
[6:20 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: So this can be done in two ways
[6:20 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: You search the with the business name you will get all the invoices of that business
[6:20 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Right?
[6:20 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: I can make it really easy lol
[6:21 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Yes tell ne
[6:21 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Ur on the view invoice. It should be sorted by latest date automatically  correct
[6:21 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Yes
[6:22 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Now there should be a filter button or dropdown that has three categories 
Latest
Paid
Unpaid
[6:22 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Yes
[6:22 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Fine
[6:22 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: It should be automatically selected on latest
[6:23 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: Yes
[6:23 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Now since all the files are saved as the business name then that makes it easier
[6:24 PM, 5/15/2022] Md. Moniruzzaman: How you want to fine all invoices with a businesse name?
[6:25 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: In the search bar whatever I search the results should be from that filter. 

So if I'm searching a business name under paid it should be only showing the paid invoices 

Same with unpaid

If the filter is on latest it should search all the invoices
[6:25 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: The search will be by business name
[6:25 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: Or date
[6:25 PM, 5/15/2022] Amr US Client: If dare is possible
