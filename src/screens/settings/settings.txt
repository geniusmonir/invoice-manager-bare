Or better off for exporting all the invoices to a zip and deleting all invoices option can only be done from the admin page
In admin setting I have the ability to add my information for the first time and edit later on
If that's possible then the app should be loaded the first time with a default logo that has status hide from invoice

ADMIN OPTIONS
Logo (Optional)?: string;
showInInvoice: boolean,

Business name: string,
My name: string,
Address: string,
Phone: string,
Website (Optional)?: string,
Email (Optional)?: string,

 ---> Now I can't add products, customers, or orders unless I have my information is filled out

 EXTRA: Or better off for exporting all the invoices to a zip and deleting all invoices option can only be done from the admin page
